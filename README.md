Welcome to the repository for **Climb High**, a solo-developed 3D vertical platformer inspired by challenging classics like *Jump King*. This game is a test of patience and precision, featuring a punishing but fair ascent with no checkpoints. The player takes on the role of a determined plant, climbing through an ever-changing forest environment to reach the top.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Unforgiving Vertical Challenge:** The entire game is one continuous vertical level. Every jump is critical, and a single missed ledge can send you plummeting back down.
* **Physics-Based Precision Platforming:** The player's movement is entirely physics-based, requiring careful control over jump height and direction.
* **Dynamic & Evolving Environments:** As you climb higher, the theme of the forest changes, introducing new visuals and platforming challenges.
